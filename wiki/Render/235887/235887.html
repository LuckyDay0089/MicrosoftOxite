<h2>What this is</h2>This is a simple blog engine written using ASP.NET MVC, and is designed with a few main goals:<br />
<ol><li>To exist as a base for our visitmix.com site and for our personal blogs (and for the blogs of other folks as well!)</li>
<li>To provide an example of &#39;core blog functionality&#39; in a reusable fashion.  Blogs are simple and well understood by many developers, but the set of basic functions that a blog needs to implement (trackbacks, rss, comments, etc.) are fairly complex. Hopefully this code helps. </li>
<li>To provide real-world code written using ASP.NET MVC that produces both valid and semantically correct markup</li></ol>
<br />Oxite supports all the features we consider essential to a blog engine, including the MetaWebLog API (to allow you to use LiveWriter or similar tools to add/edit your posts), trackbacks, pingbacks, Sitemaps (for search engines), RSS and ATOM feeds (at the site, blog, tag and post level ... plus feeds of all new comments... great for the site owner), tags, integrated search, web based admin features (including editing posts, your site settings, etc.), email subscriptions for new comments, basic support to publish &#39;pages&#39; (non-blog content) and more.<br /><br />This code is the foundation of a real project of ours, <a href="http://visitmix.com">MIX Online</a>.  We also created this project to be the base of our own personal blogs as well so you&#39;ll probably see our blogs on the <a href="https://oxite.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=oxitesites&referringTitle=Home">list of sites running Oxite</a> soon.<br /><br />There are many different ways to architect and implement a site using ASP.NET MVC, and this isn&#39;t supposed to be <b>the</b> reference application for ASP.NET MVC. For that, check out <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/mvc-storefront/">Rob Conery&#39;s MVC Storefront application</a> (there are others, <a href="http://asp.net/mvc">start here</a>). Our team has read a great deal of the available guidance and has worked hard to produce an application that follows many of the best practices recommended by the ALT.NET community around ASP.NET MVC.<br />
<h2>What this isn&#39;t</h2>
<ol><li>This isn&#39;t a finished product. It has no install, it has no documentation. It is our code, exactly as we are using it. If you&#39;d like something that is farther along and has all the support, documentation and handy installation features you&#39;d expect from a finished product, then you might want to check out <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/blogengine">BlogEngine.NET</a>, <a href="http://subtextproject.com/">SubText</a> or <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/dasBlog">dasBlog</a> ... we are fans of all of these blogging engines... none of which use MVC <b>at the moment</b> but are far more &#39;finished&#39;.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/blogsvc">BlogSvc</a> is a .NET, ASP.NET MVC blogging engine that a few people have told us about. We haven&#39;t looked at it, but if you are looking for an ASP.NET MVC based blogging engine then you may wish to check it out.</li>
<li>This isn&#39;t for non-developers. This follows somewhat from the previous point, but to be clear... if you aren&#39;t familar with a web.config and with some database poking, then this isn&#39;t the project for you. You might have more luck with the other blog engines mentioned in the previous point, but for a non-dev I&#39;d probably suggest you check out <a href="http://graffiticms.com/">Graffiti</a>.</li></ol>
