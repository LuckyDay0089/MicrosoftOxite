<div class="wikidoc"><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<b>Q:</b> Why do we need another blog engine?<br /><b>A:</b> At the time of this post, there currently aren&#39;t any big ASP.NET MVC example applications.  Oxite is meant to be a good example to learn about ASP.NET MVC.  At the same time, we think it is a useful sample to get a site of your own going too.<br /><br /><b>Q:</b> I&#39;m not a developer.  Is Oxite for me?<br /><b>A:</b> Currently, no.  Oxite is targeted at developers who want to learn ASP.NET MVC.  That said, if you&#39;re a devigner (someone who is both a developer + designer) you might really like Oxite too.  We work well in Visual Studio Express.  This is a community project.  If the community decides to build this to work well for consumers down the road we won&#39;t stop it, and then Oxite would be for you.<br /><br />More coming soon...</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
