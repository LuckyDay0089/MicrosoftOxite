One problem, though: since Pages aren't assigned to an area, how should I go about dealing with security? Should anyone who can log in be able to edit/add/delete Pages? If we add the Pages to an area, will that break anything else? Should the Pages for a particular User be placed under a specific relative path? Thoughts?\r\n",
