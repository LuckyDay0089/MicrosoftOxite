When I load Oxite it throws an error saying that the local user isn't able to login to the database, then if I refresh the page it displays the &quot;Server Error in '/' Application. A route named 'Site' could not be found in the route collection.

However I don't think it's because SQL Server is open, but rather probably has something to do with attaching the mdb file.<br>\r\nI'm just messing about with Oxite at the minute and looking at what DB tables are affected etc. but I suggest you should create a new database, run the scripts, and then just point your web.config to this. You shouldn't get the error again (if indeed you got it for the same reasons as I did).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathal. \r\n",
