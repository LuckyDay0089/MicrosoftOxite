Everything looks fine... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you can see: <a href=\"http://tom.is-a-geek.org/\">http://tom.is-a-geek.org/</a><br>\r\nNone of my posts are displayed in the default 'Blog' area.<br>\r\nNothing is returned from search either... not even about page related stuff sooooo it's obviously a coding issue somewhere... I haven't edited any of that though, wouldn't know where to start with ASP... yet anyway :-)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdeas? xD\r\n",
