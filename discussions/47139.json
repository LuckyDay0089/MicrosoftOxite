    "Html": "<p>@adr_k Yes, you are right (across the board).  :)</p>\r\n<p>@jerrysdean43 Sorry about the confusion.  We wanted to make sure that anyone that wanted to ship the MDF that we ship with Oxite would have a unique SiteID (used for generating the AntiForgeryToken) and just make everyone run through the setup themselves (which will inherently make sure the SiteID is new and unique), but I completely forgot that there wouldn't then be an about page.  I think it would be weird to take About out of the menu with what comes out of the box with Oxite so to make sure this confusion goes away I'm going to revert the MDF back to what it was and put an explaination of SiteID in the &quot;Getting Started with Oxite&quot; doc.  We will probably have to readdress this issue in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks everyone!</p>\r\n",
