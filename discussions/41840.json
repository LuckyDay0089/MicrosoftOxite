These are the steps i took:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Make a copy of the <a></a>Oxite_Database.mdf file using the &quot;Microsoft SQL Server Data Publishing Wizard&quot;. You need to have SQL 2005 Express installed to do this.<br>\r\n-Create an empty SQL 2005/2000 database.<br>\r\n-Run the created .sql file from step 1 on your new database.<br>\r\n-Update the connectionstring in your Oxite web.config file to point to the new database.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood luck!<br>\r\n",
