At first I got the\r\nredirect problem but I fixed it by changing the web.config from this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;site name=&quot;Oxite Sample&quot; host=&quot;http://localhost:30913&quot;\r\nid=&quot;4F36436B-0782-4a94-BB4C-FD3916734C03&quot; languageDefault=&quot;en&quot;\r\ntimeZoneOffset=&quot;-8&quot;\r\ngravatarDefault=&quot;http%3A%2F%2Ffarm4.static.flickr.com%2F3161%2F3075626008_bafe9b2801.jpg%3Fv%3D0&quot;\r\n/&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nto this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;site name=&quot;Oxite Sample&quot; host=&quot;http://myOxiteApp.domain.com&quot;\r\nid=&quot;4F36436B-0782-4a94-BB4C-FD3916734C03&quot; languageDefault=&quot;en&quot;\r\ntimeZoneOffset=&quot;-8&quot;\r\ngravatarDefault=&quot;http%3A%2F%2Ffarm4.static.flickr.com%2F3161%2F3075626008_bafe9b2801.jpg%3Fv%3D0&quot;\r\n/&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is running ok, I guess, but everytime I run oxite I got the forms\r\nauthentication form instead of the hello.world(). I guess there is a\r\nproblem becasue if I run the application in its original location\r\n(localhost:30913) it runs perfectly and with no forms authentication\r\nform until I click on the login link. How can I configure it so the app\r\nlets me see the default with no authentication required. I've been\r\nmessing around with the &lt;location path=&quot;&quot;&gt; in the web.config but\r\nwith no luck, no hello.world(), no css styles... just the\r\nauthentication form.\r\n",
