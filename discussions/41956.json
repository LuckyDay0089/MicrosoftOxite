Actually i am using <a title=BlogEngine.NET href=\"http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/\">BlogEngine.NET</a> as blogging platform, which runs smoothly and perfectly on my server.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would like to try/migrate to Oxite but I can't afford buying a Windows 2003/8 Server lisence. So my cuestion is:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<em><strong>Is it possible to make it run also under Microsoft Windows 2000 Server?</strong></em><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreetings from Spain!!!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.d.: Visit my web at: <a href=\"http://www.gunner.es\">http://www.gunner.es</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n;-)\r\n",
