    "Description": "The Oxite team are dividing up the data access into Repositories, which is a good thing for testability and is a nice concise pattern to work with. \nWhat's not so good is that this scheme is then wrapped in the ProviderModel, which is responsible for configuring and setting a subset of Repositories (but not all of them). \n \nGenerally speaking, Providers are usually instantiated once (Singleton) from the ConfigurationSettings that you provide (doing so more than once is a perf hit, usually). I'm still not completely clear what's happening with the Provider stuff - right now it's using a Singleton pattern but the locking has been commented out - which leads me to believe that the Provider is instantiated for every Controller call, which means multiple provider instances per application, which means ... general confusion: (...)\n \nMy suggestion here is that Repositories don't need Providers - you can use <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/learn/mvc-videos/video-366.aspx\">Dependency Injection to get around this</a>.\n \nFrom <a href=\"http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/some-thoughts-on-oxite/ \">Rob Conery's blog</a>.",
