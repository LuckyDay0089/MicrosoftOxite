The project type is not supported...\" (please see attached screenshot) after following each installation step by the letter as per the getting started page, and I've reviewed all the (2) articles here regarding this same issue but neither of them have helped. \n \nWe have VS 2008 Professional Edition w/ SP1 installed, and all pre-req's have been deployed as per instructions, yet this error refuses to go away. Could someone please help?\n \nHow do I get this working please?\n \nMany thanks,\nPhilip",

Yes, we have ASP.NET MVC v.1 installed successfully on a clean VS 2008 Professional Edition instance, running on a clean install of Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition.
