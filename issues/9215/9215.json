    "Description": "Guys,\n \nYou all might be very busy with PDC. The LIVE silverlight streaming is perfect man. Super, you guys really rocks. Congratulations.\n \nBack to business now, I downloaded the latest Oxite from sourcecode tab and try to install it. It was fine and seen the front page hello world. When I change site settings using the admin -> site settings, the settings are not reflecting in the front end. They are changing in the database but the front end is showing the old values always.\n \nPlease do something and fix this problem. Already wasted countless hours on this and downloaded the release code from the Downloads tab and it is working fine. But I want the latest code.\n \nCheers,\nNarendra",
