      "Message": "Added Blog ML importing in the most recent check-in. You put a BlogML.xml file into the root of your site and then go to /Admin/BlogMLImport/ ... it blows away what is there and adds your data in. Obviously could use some UI and more options, but it is a start and was enough to get all of Erik's data brought into the system.",
