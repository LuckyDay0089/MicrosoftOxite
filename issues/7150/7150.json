    "Description": "You have a route (PageOfPosts) that supports pagination of posts, but doesn't support specifying the data format.  It seems reasonable that you would want to get an RSS feed that only gave you a certain number of items.  I think you should make this available in the product.  \n \nIn my case, I only need 10 items so I modified the PageOfPosts as follows:\n \nAddRoute(\n          \"PageOfPosts\",\n          \"page{pageNumber}/{dataFormat}\",\n           new { controller = \"Post\", action = \"List\", dataFormat = \"\" },\n           new { pageNumber = new IsInt(), dataFormat = \"(|RSS|ATOM)\" },\n           new { Namespaces = controllerNamespaces }\n           );\n \nIt seems, however, that the PageSizeActionFilter makes the page size 50 for RSS and ATOM so you might want to consider revising that filter as well.",

      "Message": "Good suggestion.  Paging isn't usually needed with feeds since most aggs just provide a If-Modified-Since header so it can be looked up since a certain date.  However, things like the Windows 7 Search Connector can use paging (and there are probably others too since the OpenSearch format has a way to do paging).  We'll take a look at this.  Thanks!",
