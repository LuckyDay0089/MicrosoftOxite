    "Description": "The following license problems exist with the 2008.12.5 release of Oxite:\nÂ \n* No copy of the Ms-PL is provided in the source, none of the source files specifically name the license. Anyone who downloads a copy of the source from a different site will be unaware of the license terms of the software\n* Binary assemblies in bin/ included without source, licenses, or links to their homepages\n  + bin/AntiXssLibrary.dll: closed-source, redistribution explicitly forbidden, see http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=EFB9C819-53FF-4F82-BFAF-E11625130C25&displaylang=en (and pay special attention to license clauses 2 and 5)\n  + bin/CookComputing.XmlRpcV2.dll: MIT/X11 license. Which version is provided? Please supply source or a link to upstream, in case of security problems with the library\n  + bin/Microsoft.Web.Mvc.*: Microsoft Source License for ASP.NET Pre-Release Components, see http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/license. Non-free license, mandates that you must pay for a commercial final version of the library (should one be released), and some components are closed-source. Also specifically forbids redistribution.\n  + bin/MvcFakes.dll: Unlicensed code from a code sample on a blog, as far as I can tell: http://weblogs.asp.net/stephenwalther/archive/2008/08/16/asp-net-mvc-tip-33-unit-test-linq-to-sql.aspx",
