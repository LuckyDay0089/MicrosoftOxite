    "Description": "Hi there, \n \nI downloaded Oxite and the necessary libraries and installed that on my local machine. After opening VS 2008 and re referenced the DLL's, I could build and Debug Oxite on my local machine. So far, so good.\nOn my hosted environment I installed the same files, generated my MSSQL database true the SQL installation scripts, uploaded the published (oxitesite project) files and run the installation the first time to setup my Oxite environment. That went well...\n \nIt's shows the first page http://www.mss2010.nl/ but every link I follow ends up in a HTML 404 error. I'm going bananas over here, because I can't reproduce it on my development machine... \nNo logs shows up in IIS.",

We use the Issue Tracker to keep track of bugs and yours appears to be a setup/deployment problem.  Thanks!",
